# Email Spam Detection
Efficiently developing an email spam detector involved data loading, preprocessing, and training a Naive Bayes classifier. Utilizing CountVectorizer for feature extraction, the model achieved notable accuracy. Visualizations, including distribution charts and ROC/Precision-Recall curves, provided comprehensive insights. 
The model demonstrated strong performance in discerning spam from non-spam emails. Accuracy metrics and visualizations contribute to a reliable spam detection foundation. Future work may involve advanced NLP techniques and model optimization for enhanced precision
